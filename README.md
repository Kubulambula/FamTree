# FamTree

:warning:
I do NOT recommend using this app as it was bodged together by awful code without any intention of maintainability or stability.

If you decide to use it, I can't promise you any support or help.


## What is it?

This app allows you to create those linear graphs and export them as **.svg** and **.pdf**

I created this app to solve a specific use-case of creating family trees where there you track the lineage of the name bearers ancestors in a linear fashion instead of a three graph.

### Notes:
* Built using: **Godot 4.0**
* Export formats: **.svg, .pdf**
* Supported languages: **english, czech**
